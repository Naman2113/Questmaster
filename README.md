# Quest-master

## Inspiration 💡💡💡

As a student programmer, I wanted to get into freelancing to make some extra money on the side. But usually employers will only hire people who have experience. What if there was a solution that allowed employers to publish bounties and pay out to people who actually did the work. Introducing QuestMaster....

Design Research ☀️
We designed keeping users in mind as the main priority for our Web3 website. The people bidding and the people auctioning both need to trust that the platform will do what will benefit each user. As a user navigates the website, they will not only gather information about what art is being bid, but will gain blockchain literacy by participating and understanding the use of their $DESO currency. It will come to the point that users don't realize our website is Web3, because it will come so naturally to them!

## What it does ❓❓

- It allows developers to ask other developers to post a bounty for an algorithm they need and provide example input and output data. 
- Our service then verifies the algorithm actually completes the task and pays out the bounty to the person who solved it. 
- The person who posted the task receives a text saying that the task has been completed.
- Our website would donate 10% of successful bidding crypto profits to starving children in need.
- We would log in using DeSo to access our $DESO cryptocurrency and make bids with it

## Features 💡

All multiple arguments for tasks.

## How we built it 💻💻

- We built our website using the following user flow diagram. We built it with Figma, with DeSo and emphasis on Web3.0 in mind.
- Combining our creativity and research abilities to build a beautiful web application on Figma. Used python, Django, HTML and CSS

## Challenges we ran into 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️

- DeSo has pretty much no documentation, and the documentation that exists is wrong. Like, this was really horrible to work with. 
- The libraries that currently exist don't work because their API documentation is wrong and out of date. This was impossible.
- One of the developers could no longer participate in the hackathon, leaving it up to us three to build the product
- First time using React Native!
- We initially started off with mobile designs and worked with React Native to build the pages; however, we realized the benefit of making this a desktop app in its flourishing glory.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🤗🤗

- Being able to get communicate using the Blockchain. Working together as a small group.
- Combining our creativity and research abilities to build a beautiful web application on Figma

## What we learned 📚📖📝

- There is a limit on the amount of Lucozade that one man can have.
- Time limitations ⏰
- How to work on a team of half hackathon beginners and half hackathon regulars 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️
- How to work on a team of half UX/UI designers and researchers and half developers 💻

## What's next for Quest Master 📝

- An attempt at using DeSo, Twilio, and Auth0
- Transferring over to ReactJS
- Fully integrating payments once the DeSo API supports it.
